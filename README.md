Roland Shen Reflections Sept 7, 2013

1) I had a hard time setting up my virtual machine until group leaders in class helped me out. Following instructions for downloading ipython and IRC was also confusing. I understand what I should have done now that I have everything set up, but I feel that the instructions could have been clearer. There was a lot of computer lingo that I couldn't process espectially after I had installed the VM VirtualBox. I didn't know how to do anything in homework-1 after the installation.

I am also trying to understand how to use github through the octocat tutorial since github still feels foreign to me. I need to get used to knowing what pulling a repository means or pushing something to someone else, as well as how to navigate through the website efficiently.

2) I have not yet had an "aha!" moment but maybe that is because I haven't spent enough time learning github. I have tried to use Git Shell for this assignment but that hasn't gone well so far.

3) If I were to take a different approach to this past week, I would have spent more time in becoming acquainted with github. I am not a very fast learner, especially when it comes to programming, so spending more time definitely would have helped. For other students, I suggest using IRC a lot. Whenever you have a problem, someone else would probably also have the same problem and maybe figured out a way to solve it by the time you ask. I didn't know what to do for this week's reflection so I went onto IRC and asked. Someone told me instructions to come to this page and post.
